# KBC_game
`Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC)`
In this project, I have made a simple **KBC** Game in **Python** which let's you ask some of the questions, and you'll be given four options for that. You have to choose the correct option else you will lost the match. Here, you'll also earn rewards as you would move forward.
To improve the features of this game, I have used `pyttsx3` module of python, which let speak all the text, that you wanna 
play, showing the replica of the original **KBC** Game. I have given the installation process of this module further.

## The Requirements

### Installation process 

To install the `pyttsx3` module, you need to install pip (python package manager). Here is a brief about it.

#### pip is a package-management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.
#### Also, python-espeak is a simple Python3 wrapper for the espeak speech synthesizer, which is a fancy way to say that it can make your computer talk.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install pyttsx3
sudo apt-get install espeak
```

If you are using Linux based OS, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `kbc.py` file is located. Now, you can run the game by using the following command.
```
python3 kbc.py
```
If you are using Windows, download python3 from the official website.
